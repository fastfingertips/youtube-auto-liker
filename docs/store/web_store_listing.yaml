    YouTube Interaction Manager - Smart Channel Assistant

    Manage your YouTube interactions automatically based on your channel preferences. Whitelist your favorites, blacklist others, and customize exactly when and how interactions happen.

    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    HOW IT WORKS

    When you open a YouTube video, the extension checks your list settings.
    - Whitelist: Auto-LIKES videos from channels you support.
    - Blacklist: Auto-DISLIKES videos from channels you want to avoid.
    - Neutral: Shows a status badge but takes no action (great for monitoring).

    You have full control over timing: triggering actions instantly, after a percentage of the video is watched, or after a specific delay. The "Humanize" mode adds randomization so interactions feel natural.
